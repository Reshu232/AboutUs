       <p> Electronic devices like cell phones, laptops, and tablets require code to function properly. Coding allows
        humans to communicate with these devices. Modern technology such as traffic lights, calculators, smart TVs, and
        cars use internal coding systems.</p> 
        

        <p>Since computers do not communicate like humans, coding acts as a translator. Code converts human input into
        numerical sequences that computers understand. Once computers receive these messages, they complete assigned
        tasks such as changing font colors or centering an image.</p> 

        <p>Read on to learn about how people use code to communicate with computers and develop electronic devices,
        machines, and other technologies.</p>

    <h1><u>Four Basics Of Coding</u></h1>
    <p>Coding tells a machine which actions to perform and how to complete tasks. Programming languages provide the
        rules for building websites, apps, and other computer-based technologies.</p>
    <p>What are the 4 basics of coding?</p>

    <li>
        <ol>ALGORITHMS - An algorithm is a list of steps followed in order to complete a task (run a program)</ol>
        <ol>    SYNTAX - Syntax refers to the specific structure, grammar, and punctuation rules that must be followed for
            that programming language </ol>
        <ol>FUNCTIONS/METHODS/PARAMETERS/ARGUMENTS</ol>
        <ol> OPERATORS </ol>

    
         </li>
        <h1><u>Uses of Coding</u></h1>
        <p>Coding (social sciences), an analytical process in which data are categorized for analysis</p>
        
        <p> Coding strand of DNA in molecular biology</p>
        <p> Legal coding, the process of creating summary or keyword data from a document in the legal profession</p>
        <p> Medical coding, representation of medical diagnoses and procedures in standard code numbers</p>
        <p> Coding (therapy), alternative therapeutic methods used to treat addictions in the post-Soviet countries</p>
